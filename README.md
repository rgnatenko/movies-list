# Movie Challenge

## The Task
The goal of this project is to implement a movie autocomplete feature using React JS. Users should be able to search for movies by name and filter the list by ratings and genres.

## What I Did
I developed a React application that provides a movie autocomplete feature based on the given requirements. I've created several components, such as a dropdown, a search field for finding movies, and a list of received movies. I've used the `https://movies-and-shows-api.cyclic.app/movies` API for fetching movies and after the first request info about movies is kept in local storage, so the next time the user clicks on input, movies will be displayed quickly.

## What Technologies Were Used
- **React library:** Used for building the user interface and managing component state.
- **Material-UI:** Utilized UI components and styling to ensure a modern and visually appealing interface.
- **TypeScript:** Employed to add static typing to the application for improved code quality and developer productivity.
- **Figma:** Referenced the provided Figma design file for UI design inspiration and guidance.
