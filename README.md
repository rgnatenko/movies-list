Functional requirements:
Initialize the movies array with the given data.
When user clicks on the movie name search input, open autocomplete with the list of all movies.
When user enters a search string in the movie name input, the autocomplete list should be updated based on the entered input.
User should be able to set multiple or any desired ratings, and based on that autocomplete list will be filtered further (for example, if user enters “Matrix” as movie name, but chooses only “1 star” rating, no movies will show).
Similarly to desired rating filter, user should be able to filter autocomplete list by genre(s).
Browser JavaScript console (in Developer Tools) does not show any javascript errors.
Use JSFiddle.net, Stackblitz or any other code sandbox platform to produce your work and send me the link.

Code requirements and standards:
Use React JS
Use HOCs, components etc. when makes sense
Only use functional components
Apply these best practices: https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/react-best-practices/
Follow Object Calisthenics rules when makes sense: https://medium.com/@davidsen/clean-code-object-calisthenics-f6f4dec07c8b
Use third-party libraries when makes sense
